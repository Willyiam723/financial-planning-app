Given your financial objectives, how much volatility (risk) are you willing to assume to achieve
your portfolio’s expected return?:
A. Zero volatility – I cannot tolerate negative returns, stability of returns is essential
B. Low volatility – I can tolerate very little variability of returns and can accept negative
returns 1 in every 7 years
C. Medium volatility – I can tolerate some variability of returns and can accept negative returns
1 in every 4 years
D. Medium to High volatility – I can tolerate variability of returns and can accept negative
returns 1 in every 2 years
E. Higher volatility – I am unconcerned with variability of returns and primarily focused on long
term growth
